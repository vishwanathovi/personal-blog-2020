Before even starting to write this article, I wanted specify why I am writing this article.

### Why?

We as a society have this taboo around mental health issues. Most/almost all of us try to avoid any open discussions about mental health. Even though I suffered from mental health issues for well over a decade, I happened to find that most people around me were unaware of the details of the mental health issues i had. In my early 20s, even i used to think that talking about mental health issues is not a good thing.

This is one of the main reasons why I am writing this article.

### Childhood

My father is many things. A alcoholic. Abusive father. World’s most strict critic (to himself & any one around him). A depression and generalized anxiety disorder sufferer self-medicating himself with alcohol. Pretty smart. As a father, he was strict to a level that brought down our self-esteem to the ground and below. His perfectionist standards put on us and himself, trained us to think we were not good enough for this world.

My mother is schizophrenic. In simple terms, my mother hears an imaginary person talking to her all the time. Schizophrenia is this condition where people are unable to understand that this is an illusion and believe that it is a person in real life. She was comfortable doing her day to day responsibilities like cooking, cleaning, and taking care of us. But, she did not have any social setup that she was part of.

I have two elder brothers. I was the youngest kid in the house.

Our family was a typical dysfunctional family. Father drinking everyday and showing abusive behaviour. My mother lost in her own struggle. Needless to say, uninvolved parenting was the norm. Emotional support was not a fundamental right. It was just a luxury during some positive phases of life.

As a kid, I was different to other kids. I missed classes very often. Home assignments got rarely completed. Personal hygiene was not comparable to my classmates. As a kid, I did not notice any of these changes but eventually teenage years would turn out different.

### College days & Start of social anxiety

So, back to my college days. Before even coming away from home, during my school days, my lifestyle was a bit different than many of my classmates. I was good in studies. Was not punctual. Did not do most of the homework assignments. Sporadically missed classes. Most of my classmates had strict parents who made sure that their children would never miss any classes, go attend some extra tuition, dress neatly, and behave properly. I was this oddball who did not fit in most of the class groups. But in a child’s mind, this felt like a mild inconvenience.

So, at 16, I moved to another town. New city, a new way of living. Away from home for the first time. In a pool of all 16-year-olds who had to form a personality and start identifying themselves as an individual in the coming years, a big task in hand. Some had a determined approach that studying well as their sole responsibility and their whole life was designed around that. Some were the rebels who were careless with the studies but were interested in other things like cricket, movies.

This is the first place where my mental illness took its birth. Social anxiety. The standard definition of social anxiety as per Wikipedia is -

> Social anxiety disorder, is an anxiety disorder characterised by sentiments of fear and anxiety in social situations, causing considerable distress and impaired ability to function in at least some aspects of daily life. These fears can be triggered by perceived or actual scrutiny from others. Individuals with social anxiety disorder fear negative evaluation from other people.

A more concise way to put it is - “A constant fear of being judged by others around“

Being a short kid with low self-esteem, it did not take a lot of time for me to develop a very bad image of myself in my head. Along with this, a perfectionist father made sure to give enough negative pointers for me to believe that everyone thought in the same way about me.

One thing that did started was the constant stream of negative thoughts about myself.

I struggled to be at ease at any moment. Any social interaction became a huge task to my brain which choose to analyze what everyone might be thinking about me. Mostly assuming the most negative possibilities. Every day going to college, spending time in the college, coming back to the hostel became a tiring task. Any time I had to walk alone alongside the road, my brain used to run the scenario of everyone on the street observing me and judging me. Thinking things like - “Look at this loser“, “This guy looks weird“, “This guy is walking weird“.

First I choose self-medicating. I started to smoke cigarettes and drink. This helped me in building some friendships. I kind of started developing this rebel kind of a personality who was careless with his education and did smoke and drink.

With everyday feeling like a rollercoaster ride of constant fear, life became a punishment. Study or any task for that matter became uninteresting. Soon, I gave up and choose the second solution(for the moment), avoidance.

I stopped going to classes on a regular basis. Mostly stayed inside the hostel only. Skipped meals to avoid going to a crowded lunch hall. Mostly spent my days talking to my roommates, sleeping, and doing regular visits to the tea-cigarette shop.

For the next 3 years, this was my life. Nothing more than a brain running like a computer with a crazy virus in it. The same way a computer virus would overheat a processor, drain the battery, does not let anyone install useful programs, reduce the performance of essential software, my brain used to run this loop of self-deprecating thoughts, drain my energy, hinder me from developing any interest or hobbies, significantly restrict my day to day living.

After 3 years, I finished my diploma and moved to do my Bachelor’s. Now moving to another and bigger city. Again the same kind of lifestyle continued. Avoiding college as much as possible. Only interacting with some friends. Struggling to walk around for regular things. A constant stream of negative thoughts.

In the second year of my bachelor’s, I got my first laptop and was officially introduced to the Internet. This was the first time I got a hold of information about mental health. Using Wikipedia and some other sources online, I got to understand things like anxiety, depression, dysfunctional family, schizophrenia, substance abuse, etc. Now, I was kind of aware of what I was going through. I still remember the first time I read the Wikipedia page about social anxiety disorder. It was as if someone observed me and wrote it in a detailed manner. I was amazed at how comparable the page was to my life.

But, just the information doesn’t change the way how our cognition has evolved. With the self-diagnosis of my mental health condition, I tried to consult some psychologists. But, after some 4-5 visits to different doctor’s I understood that most of these people were either uninformed or misinformed about things like CBT and other latest advancements in the field of psychology. I also tried to work out regularly(a suggestion I saw online) but failed to adopt the habit.
I continued my next 3 years of life the same way. Avoiding, drinking, smoking. An overactive brain that is just over-working in an unproductive way.

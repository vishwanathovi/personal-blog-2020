In the 30 years of my life on this earth, More than being a mover/ creator, I have mostly been an observer/ investigator.
Since my school days, I was not the kid who was interested in any particular subject. I was just going with the flow. I never saw any particular importance in education. It was not as if I denied the importance of education, it was more of a casual perspective towards the system.
Due to this, I was perceived as an oddball. Classmates who almost unanimously agreed on the importance of being serious about education saw me as a misinformed kid.
Maybe my personality type and my parents who showed zero involvement in my education enabled me to have a casual perspective on education and lead my childhood life.
As I grew up & went on to do my higher education, I started to observe people's motivation towards many things. Education, respect from peers, acceptance by society, societal status, approval of opposite gender and so on the list goes.

Javascript comes with a powerful set of array and string methods. Provided they are used in a clever way, they can help us write some concise and efficient solutions.
Most of the coders new to Javascript ( and programming) will become comfortable using these methods individually and make use of them to an extent. But the concept of chaining turns these methods as a building block of a simple solution to complex problems.
In this article, we will be discussing the things to know while chaining and then we will be taking a problem and try to solve them using string/array method chaining.
Before we start off, let's look at what is chaining.

> Method chaining, is a common syntax for invoking multiple method callsÂ . Each method returns an object/array/string, allowing the calls to be chained together in a single statement without requiring variables to store the intermediate results.

### Professional
I would like to categorize myself as close to Machine learning engineering than any other job description. On a day to day basis, I code in Python, Java, Javascript. If I can define what I can do, it would be
* Build Machine learning (Regression, Time series analysis, Random forest) & Deep learning(CNN - Image Processing) models
* Build backend features in Django (Python), Node (JS), Play (Java). I mainly work on building features that are required from the Data science front.
* Build simple web apps using React, Vanilla JS

I completed my bachelor's in 2013 in Electronics & Communications. Post that i have worked as for last 6 years with companies like <a href="https://www.flipkart.com/" target="_blank">Flipkart</a>, MuSigma & SigTuple. Below is a short timeline and a summary of my professional experience.

I strongly believe in being open about mental issues & seek help. But still, the taboo around mental illness makes it a hard topic to be conveyed to many around me on a day to day basis.**

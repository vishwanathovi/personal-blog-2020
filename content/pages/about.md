### Professional
I would like to categorize myself as close to Machine learning engineering than any other job description. On a day to day basis, I code in Python, Java, Javascript. If I can define what I can do, it would be
* Build Machine learning (Regression, Time series analysis, Random forest) & Deep learning(CNN - Image Processing) models
* Build backend features in Django (Python), Node (JS), Play (Java). I mainly work on building features that are required from the Data science front.
* Build simple web apps using React, Vanilla JS

I completed my bachelor's in 2013 in Electronics & Communications. Post that i have worked for last 6 years with companies like <a href="https://www.flipkart.com/" target="_blank">Flipkart</a>, <a href="https://www.mu-sigma.com/" target="_blank">MuSigma</a> & <a href="https://www.sigtuple.com/" target="_blank">SigTuple</a>. I started my career as a Business analyst later transitioning into development then into data science.

### Personal

Apart from work, I
* Read books (You can check out my collections <a href="http://goodreads.com/vishwaovi">here</a>)
* Work out (Yoga 🧘, badminton 🏸, cycling 🚴‍♂️)
* Actively follow Rap music(Eminem, J Cole 🤘), UFC (Khabib, Rose 👊) & Comedy(Conan, Chappelle, CK 😄)
* Also like Bike rides & Treks too 🙂

>> **I am also a recovering <a href="https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/guide/mental-health-social-anxiety-disorder#1" target="_blank">Social anxiety disorder</a> patient. I strongly believe in being open about mental issues & seek help. But still, the taboo around mental illness makes it a hard topic to be discussed with many around me on a day to day basis.**
